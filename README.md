# Java.net Server - Fortune Cookie Generator

A simple java application for understanding how to create a bare bone server that gives a fortune cookie.

As this project doesn't have any dependencies, and is a single file server, we will not be using a build tool such as Maven here.

# Compiling the `Server.java` file

```$xslt
javac src/com/company/Server.java
```

# Running the Server on Port 3000

```$xslt
java -cp src com.company.Server 3000
```
